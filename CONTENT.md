# PivotArc â€” Make the Pivotal Transition

## Your SaaS outgrew its first architecture. Now what?

When reliability wobbles, costs spiral, and features take forever to ship â€” you need an architectural pivot. I've done these transitions at Microsoft and Google. Now I help SaaS companies make their pivotal transition without breaking production.

**My credentials:**  
â€¢ Early-stage SaaS (6 years): Built multi-tenant services from scratch for 20k+ customers  
â€¢ Microsoft (9 years): Reliability Champion, zero-downtime migrations for millions of users  
â€¢ Google (3 years): Built SaaS Runtime platform from scratch, API Council, reliability guidelines  
â€¢ Global team leadership: 15+ years aligning distributed teams across US, EU, Asia, and Australia

## Why PivotArc

### No BS Approach
- **Fixed scope:** Clear deliverables, no scope creep

- **Honest assessment:** If I can't help, I'll tell you upfront

While I bring systematic approaches and proven patterns from Microsoft and Google, I never apply cookie-cutter solutions. Every engagement starts with understanding your unique business goals, constraints, and team dynamics. The solution we design together will balance the right tradeoffs for YOUR situation â€” not what worked somewhere else.

### My Journey: From Startup to Hyperscale

**Phase 1: Early SaaS Builder (6 years)**  
â€¢ Designed and built multi-tenant CRM/financial platform serving 20k+ monthly customers across 8 merchants
â€¢ Architected distributed email marketing platform processing millions of messages â€” still running reliably today
â€¢ Learned the hard way: how tenant isolation failures, customization debt, and architectural shortcuts compound into crises

**Phase 2: Microsoft Azure (9 years)**  
â€¢ Senior Tech Lead & Reliability Champion: transformed incident culture across multiple teams
â€¢ Led zero-downtime migrations and consolidations for services with millions of active users
â€¢ Designed extensibility frameworks enabling features to ship 3x faster while improving reliability

**Phase 3: Google Cloud (3 years)**  
â€¢ Uber Tech Lead (UTL): architected SaaS Runtime platform from zero for planetary-scale multi-tenancy
â€¢ Co-founded API Council establishing quality standards across 50+ foundational services
â€¢ Authored reliability processes and postmortem guidelines adopted across multiple product areas

### What This Means for You

I've lived through every stage of SaaS growth:
- The fragile first version held together with hope
- The growth phase where everything starts breaking
- The hyperscale patterns that actually work

Now I help you bridge these stages without learning everything the hard way.
